Fix a wildcard redirects (Nexjs fights with Cloudflare) the-guild-org/shared-config#657
NextJS requires `docs/things/:path*` syntax, but that does not work on Cloudflare.
Redirects in CF uses `*` and `:splat`.
With `:path*` the redirect from "docs/old/:path*" to "docs/new/:path*" becomes "docs/new/foo*"

```diff
- /docs/integrations/:path* /docs/other-integrations/:path* 302
+ /docs/integrations/* /docs/other-integrations/:splat 302
```
